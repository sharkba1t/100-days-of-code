# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<!--
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the CSS for a practice project and some katas on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) for Python and JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I almost gave up on the practice project because the CSS was a mess, and I couldn't fix it. I redid the CSS, and I finally got it to look the way as intended.

On the other hand, the Katas went smoothly. I got one of them to work on the first try.

### Day 2: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  
+ made a static webpage for a fictional club using flexbox and grid. I made a rough wireframe using Adobe XD and then gathered the assets.  
+ finished a couple of Katas on Codewars in JavaScript

**Thoughts:**  
The process for the website went a lot smoother than the last time I worked on any CSS project.  
One of the Katas, the Roman Numerals Encoder was tough. I was trying to skip the steps and write clean code in one try, which I failed because I couldn't work out the algorithm at first. It took me quite a while to figure out (and also learned how NOT to use switch case), but I made the code work. Also, by comparing my code with others, I learned how to think differently when solving problems.

### Day 3: January 3, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ learned class & runtime enviroments for JavaScript
+ learned the basics of Django
+ finished a 4kyu kata on Codewars.com

**Thoughts:**  
JavaScript class was very similar to Python's class. I also refreshed my memories on getter and setter methods as I was learning.  
I also learned the basics of Django: how to start a new project, run the server, and add apps to the project. In the process, I also got more familiar with command-line commands. It really is "use it or lose it" with things you learned!  
Finally, I solved a 4kyu kata on Codewars. The algorithm was tough to work out, but I eventually got it. The solution wasn't perfect, but I got to learn from others' solutions.

### Day 3.5: January 4, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ solved a couple katas on codewars.com

**Thoughts:**  
I am experiencing burnout, so there is not much progress today. Therefore there is no progress on learning/projects. I didn't track the time it took to solve the katas.

### Day 4: January 5, 2022
**Today's Progress**:
+ finished JavaScript Syntax Part III on Codecademy

**Thoughts:**  
The burnt-out is not as bad as yesterday, but it is still here. I'm glad I still made decent progress in learning, though. On top of learning, I need to work on retraining my knowledge, which means I need to plan a review session in the future.

### Day 5: January 7, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ Began working on a calculator app in the browser
+ learn about TDD(Test Driven Development) and using Mocha for JavaScript
+ (not coding) Read about Async JavaScript, HTTP Requests, security, and API.

**Thoughts:**  
I took a break the day before because of hand pain. Posture and rest are important.  
I experienced "use it or lose it" when making the calculator app. I almost forgot how to use JavaScript for DOM! Luckily, a couple of quick searches and reading notes fixed that issue.  
On top of that, I did some reading that's not directly related to coding but related to Front-End. Some of the concepts are hard to understand at first, but I will have a better understanding as I learn more about them.

### Day 6: January 8, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ Continued learning Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests.  
+ worked on the calculator app

**Thoughts:**  
I am slowly picking up the pace of learning. Async JavaScript was tough to understand at first, but I finished the lesson.  
I noticed the text overflows from the calculator display window if too many digits are entered, but instead of fixing it, I added a popup window claiming "it's a feature". I am experimenting with "pop-up windows" and draggable elements using JavaScript, and I ended up diving into a rabbit hole of learning [why using `event.pageX` will result in the IDE warning "event is deprecated"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64585035/im-trying-to-call-event-but-my-visual-code-say-event-is-deprecated-ts6385) ([MDN documentation linked in the answer here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64585035/im-trying-to-call-event-but-my-visual-code-say-event-is-deprecated-ts6385))

### Day 7: January 9, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ finished learning Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests.
+ learned about web apps  
+ worked on portfolio site

**Thoughts:**  
I finally finished the first 15 modules of Front-End Path on Codecademy, well, except for the portfolio site project. I skipped it to keep learning so I won't have an excuse to procrastinate from my lessons by saying, "I haven't done the project yet. I can't move on!"  
I will start the React unit in the upcoming week.  
I finally figured out how to make a toggle switch using HTML & CSS, and I found out what I did wrong before and why the switch background won't change color. On top of that, I finally put my knowledge of CSS transition & animations to use by making an animated header for my portfolio site.  
I still haven't fully figured out how to make a draggable window yet. I'll figure it out eventually.

### Day 8: January 10, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ began learning React & JSX

**Thoughts:**  
I began learning about the React framework today. It feels like a lifesaver with how easy it is to use it & manage the content on a web page!
I can only imagine my future web projects will be a lot easier now that I know how to use React.


### Day 9: January 11, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ continued working on portfolio website template

**Thoughts:**  
I decided to come back to this project because I did not want to keep procrastinating from working on it. I  originally wanted to make a slide show for the project display section. I also decided to turn this into a prototype project instead of my actual portfolio site to mitigate the stress of making it perfect (also why I keep procrastinating from it!)
I managed to make the tab highlight work for the project section, and during the process, I learned about using "classList" to get a list of class names of a selected element in JavaScript, which opens to many possibilities with what I can do!

### Day 10: January 12, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ finished portfolio website template

**Thoughts:**  
I forgot to log my previous days of progress, but I am catching up on writing the logs! ( Also, I passed my earlier logs into Grammarly to fix some spelling and grammatical issues.)

It was a rocky journey to code the website. I am not too satisfied with the final design, but I decided to stop here. I will apply the experiences I learned from this project in my future projects. I also realize why people generally work with the "mobile-first" philosophy. Fixing all the breakpoint problems when my original site was designed for a fullscreen browser page was not fun!
Part of my dissatisfaction with the website lies underneath the design (or the lack thereof). I am unfortunately not a designer (though I can proudly say I don't make some... interesting design choices, such as using a neon color background with serif fonts as some projects I've seen.) However, this will be something  I address as I learn. I also plan on learning Adobe XD for quick wireframing & prototyping.

### Day 11: January 13, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ continue learning about React on Codecademy
    + components
    + props

**Thoughts:**  
I learned about React Components and props today. Some of the new concepts were confusing at first, such as the event handler as a prop in a component instance vs an actual event handler in the JSX. They may look similar but they are not!
I also need to start working on some HTML/CSS projects to keep my skills sharps. Use it or lose it!

### Day 12: January 14, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ continue learning about React on Codecademy
  + state
  + passing state from parent component to child components


**Thoughts:**  
I continued learning React.js today. I learned about "state" and passing the state from a stateful parent class to stateless child classes. I also learned about managing & structuring components.  
I found them overwhelming at first because of all the new concepts, but once I took time away from the materials & recap without looking at the materials, I could make sense of them. This experience gave me insights into my learning styles; I will try not to cram too much at once and then give myself time to process new materials in the future.  

#### Why I stopped posting on Twitter:
I have stopped updating my progress on Twitter since my short break for various reasons. I understand that part of this challenge is to show progress publicly; thus, you are held accountable to follow through. On top of that, you can find and offer support in the community. However, I prefer not to maintain one more social media account to update my progress.  
Instead, I will keep updating this GitHub log to document my progress and thoughts during my journey.  

### Day 13: January 15, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ continue learning React on Codecademy
  + Lifecycle methods
  + began practice projects of React
+ a couple Katas on Codewars
  

**Thoughts:**  
I learned about lifecycle methods in React.js today. Again, it felt daunting at first with all the new concepts, which is a sign that I need to take a step back and process the new knowledge. I worry that I cannot remember the name for all of the new methods, but I believe with practice I will get used to using them.

I also began the practice project called "jammming" in the lesson. It is a huge project with 99 steps, but the first few parts focus on creating new files for separate components, which I assume is for getting used to the process of making a React app. 

I went back to solving katas on Codewars to make sure I rememeber how Python and vanilla JavaScript works. Since i am currently at 5kyu, the site automatically recommends me 4kyu katas, which are a bit tough for me at the moment, so my plan will be to work a low level kata as warm up and then work on a random 5kyu kata instead.
