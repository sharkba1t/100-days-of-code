# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<!--
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the CSS for a practice project and some katas on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) for Python and JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I almost gave up on the practice project because the was CSS was a mess and I couldn't fix it. I redid the CSS and I finally got it to look the way as intended.

On the other hand, the Katas went smoothly. I got one of them to work on the first try.

### Day 2: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  
+ made a static webpage for a fictional club using flexbox and grid. I made a rough wireframe using Adobe XD, and then gathered the assets.  
+ finished a couple Katas on Codewars in JavaScript

**Thoughts:**  
The process for the website went a lot smoother than last time I worked on any CSS project.  
One of the Katas, the Roman Numerals Encoder was tough for me. I was trying to skip the steps and write clean code in one try, which I failed, because I wasn't able to work out the algorithm at first. It took me quite a while to figure out (and also learned how NOT to use switch case), but I made the code work. Also by comparing my code with others, I learned how to think differently when solving problems.
