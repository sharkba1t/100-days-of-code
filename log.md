# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<!--
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the CSS for a practice project and some katas on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) for Python and JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I almost gave up on the practice project because the was CSS was a mess and I couldn't fix it. I redid the CSS and I finally got it to look the way as intended.

On the other hand, the Katas went smoothly. I got one of them to work on the first try.

### Day 2: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  
+ made a static webpage for a fictional club using flexbox and grid. I made a rough wireframe using Adobe XD, and then gathered the assets.  
+ finished a couple Katas on Codewars in JavaScript

**Thoughts:**  
The process for the website went a lot smoother than last time I worked on any CSS project.  
One of the Katas, the Roman Numerals Encoder was tough for me. I was trying to skip the steps and write clean code in one try, which I failed, because I wasn't able to work out the algorithm at first. It took me quite a while to figure out (and also learned how NOT to use switch case), but I made the code work. Also by comparing my code with others, I learned how to think differently when solving problems.

### Day 3: January 3, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ learned class & runtime enviroments for JavaScript
+ learned the basics of Django
+ finished a 4kyu kata on Codewars.com

**Thoughts:**  
JavaScript class was very similar to Python class. I also refreshed my memories on getter and setter methods as I was learning.  
I also learned the basics of Django: how to start a new project, run the server, and to add apps to the project. In the process I also got more familiar with command line commands. It really is use it or lose it with things you learned!  
Finally, I solved a 4kyu kata on Codewars. The algorithm was a bit tough to work out, but I got it eventually. The solution wasn't perfect, but I got to learn from others' solutions.

### Day 3.5: January 4, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ solved a couple katas on codewars.com

**Thoughts:**  
I am experiencing burnt out so not much progress today, so no progress on learning/projects. I didn't track the time it took for me to solve the katas.

### Day 4: January 5, 2022
**Today's Progress**:
+ finished JavaScript Syntax Part III on Codecademy

**Thoughts:**  
The burnt out is not as bad as yesterday, but it is still here. I'm glad I still made decent progress in learning, though. On top of learning, I need to work on retraining my knowledge, which means I need to plan a review session in the future.

### Day 5: January 7, 2022
**Today's Progress**:  
+ Began working on a calculator app in the browser
+ learn about TDD(Test Driven Development) and using Mocha for JavaScript
+ (not coding) Read about Async JavaScript, HTTP Requests, security, and API.

**Thoughts:**  
I took a break the day before because of hand pain. Posture and rest are important.  
I experienced "use it or lose it" when I tried to make the calculator app. I almost forgot how to use JavaScript for DOM! Luckily, a couple quick searches and reading notes fixed that issue.  
On top of that, I did some reading on that's not directly related to coding, but related to Front-End. Some of the concepts are hard to understand at first, but I will have a better understanding as I learn more about them.
